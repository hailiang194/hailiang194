# Luong The Hai
Hi, there. My name is Hai from Vietnam. It is great to meet you.
## Can you introduce a little bit about yourself
Yes, of course. My name is Hai(not Luong). You can call me Hai Liang. Currently, I am a student at FPT University and study Software Engineering. I am interested in writing Hanzi(Chinese characters), prgramming and watching Kamen Rider.
## When have you been programming and how did you start it?
I started to programming when I was 15 years old. I was surprised because I could write something that made my computer work.
