🇯🇵 ルオン・テ・ハイ

I learnt how to write a program in 2015. I was surprised and amazed because I could write my own program at the first time. After that, I continuously tried to learn it by myself. However, At that moment, I didn't have a computer and have to wait to Computer lesson to use computer to code. Because of that, I think I really like programming. Luckily, my parents bought for me a laptop and that is one of the best present they gave me and it made me easier to learn coding. When I was 17, I learnt C programming language and I really like it. It help me to understand many things in programming and how computers work. After learning it in 3 months, I have create my first game in C. That is snake game in console application and I always proud of it(The video about snake game below).

I am a student in FPT University. I study Software Engineering to follow my interest and try to have great time here. I love the environment here. It make me become more active.

There are so many things I have to learn so why don't we can learn each other?
